          <h2>Have some questions about 4-H?</h2>
          <p>
            We may have some answers...
          </p>
          <h3>What is 4-H?</h3>
          <p>
            4-H is an informal, practical educational program for youth. It is the youth development program of Michigan State University Cooperative Extension. 4-H is where there's fun in learning and learning in fun!
          </p>
          <h3>
            What is the mission of 4-H?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The  4-H program uses a learn-by-doing approach to enable youth to develop the knowledge, attitudes, and skills they need to become competent, caring, and contributing citizens of the world. This mission is accomplished by using the knowledge and resources of the land-grant university system, along with the involvement of caring adults.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Isn't 4-H just for kids who live on farms?
          </h3>
          <p>
            No! 4-H is for all youth, wherever they live--on farms, in suburbs, in cities. 4-H serves youth from all backgrounds and interests. It reaches both boys and girls through 4-H clubs, special-interest groups and short-term projects, individual & family learning & mentoring, camping, and school enrichment. Most 4-H members are from towns and cities and they participate in contemporary projects such as bicycle care and safety, consumer education, aerospace and model rocketry, animal sciences and ROBOTICS. 4-H offers membership without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or handicap.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What is a 4-H club?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Clubs are the foundation of the 4-H program. A 4-H club is a group of five or more youngsters guided by one or more adult volunteer leaders. A club can be any size from a small group of kids from one neighborhood to a larger club consisting of youth from all over the county.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What happens in a 4-H club?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A 4-H club usually concentrates on one or more projects such as gardening, woodworking, small animals, food and nutrition, karate, photography, etc. 4-H members build leadership by electing officers and conducting their own business meetings; work together on community service activities; meet new friends; and most important, have lots of fun.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What age must you be to join 4-H?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Youth, ages 9-19 (one year out of high school), can be standard 4-H club members and enroll in many different 4-H projects. Members of this age may exhibit their completed work to be judged for awards. Youth, ages 5-8 can be 4-H Cloversprout members. The 4-H Cloversprout program is a noncompetitive learning experience.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What do the four H's on the 4-H emblem stand for?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The 4-H emblem is a green four-leaf clover with a white 'H' on each leaflet, symbolizing Head, Heart, Hands, and Health. The 4-H emblem was patented in 1924.
          </p>
          <h3>
            What is the 4-H pledge?
          </h3>
          <p>
            At 4-H club meetings and other 4-H events, 4-H members recite the Pledge of Allegiance and this 4-H pledge:
          </p>
<pre class="pledge">
I pledge my Head to clearer thinking,
my Heart to greater loyalty,
my Hands to larger service,
and my Health to better living,
for my club, my community,
my country, and my world.
</pre>
